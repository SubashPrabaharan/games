            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player can select to play as either Alexios or Kassandra,[1] Greek mercenaries and descendants of the Spartan king Leonidas I. In addition to completing the story campaign, players can freely explore a large open world set in Greece on foot or on horseback.[2] As the player explores the world, they will encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs) who give players side missions to complete.[3] They also discover locations of interests, clear out fortresses and camps, explore tombs and shipwrecks, and collect hidden treasures.[4][5] Synchronization points in various landmarks in Greece, which serve as fast travel points, can also be unlocked.[6] Players can also collect various crafting resources, such as iron ore, wood, leather, metal, and precious gems, through exploration and hunting wildlife.[7] Other side activities players can undertake include competing in a gladiatorial arena and completing time-limited bounties and contracts.[8][9] Unlike the previous games in the series, Odyssey offers two modes of gameplay: Guided mode shows the player the locations of their objects immediately using waypoints, while Exploration mode tasks players to find out the locations themselves after being given brief clues from other NPCs.[10][11]

        <h3>Combat</h3>
        <p>
            There are two modes of melee attackâ€”light attacks are fast but weak, while heavy attacks are slow but strong. Players can also dodge hostile attacks, or parry them.[22] The player character can use different types of melee weapons such as spears, heavy blunt weapons, daggers, swords, and bows and arrows to defeat enemies.[23] The player may also need to equip armor. boots, helmets, and gloves.[24] The game features a weapon and gear system in which each weapon and piece of armor the player wears has different statistics and provides a range of advantages.[25] These can be equipped and upgraded individually, with additional gameplay benefits imbued into the weapons through engraving.[14] The strength and power of these weapons depend on their level as well as their rarity. The rarer the weapon, the more powerful it is, though the cost of upgrading it is also more expensive.[25] The player character also commandeers a warship named Adrestia to explore the Aegean Sea. Players can launch arrows and javelins against hostile ships, cleave opponent ships directly, and command the crew to brace when they are attacked. When the health of enemy ship is nearly depleted, the player character can initiate naval boarding. Successful boarding provides the player with additional resources and restores the health of the Adrestia.[26] The ship is upgradable; the player can improve the strength of the hull and boost the stamina of the rowers.[27] While the player is exploring the sea, they may encounter Alpha ships, which are essentially enemy bosses that the players can defeat.[28]

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
            Odyssey's story begins in 480 BC, where King Leonidas leads the Spartan army against a Persian charge during the Battle of Thermopylae. The skirmish is won, but Leonidas is informed by a captured enemy that the Persian army has learned of the mountain path and will surround the Spartans by morning. Nevertheless, Leonidas resolves to hold off the Persian advance. In 2018, Layla Hassan recovers Leonidas' spear and extracts from it the DNA of his grandchildren, Alexios and Kassandra, to be used for her Animus to find the location of the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus. Whichever sibling is selected by the player (and therefore, by Layla) is designated as the Eagle Bearer.
