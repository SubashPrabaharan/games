        Many years after defeating the Olympian gods,[e] Kratos lives with his son Atreus in the realm of Midgard and is often abrasive and passive aggressive towards him. After cremating the body of Faye, Kratos is confronted by a stranger with godly powers. The two battle and Kratos seemingly kills the stranger, after which Kratos and Atreus begin their journey to honor Faye's last wish: to scatter her ashes at the highest peak in the nine realms.
