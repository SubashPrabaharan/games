            Red Dead Redemption 2 is a Western-themed action-adventure game. Played from a first- or third-person perspective, the game is set in an open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the United States in 1899.[1] It features single-player and online multiplayer components, the latter released under Red Dead Online.[2] For most of the game, the player controls outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, as he completes missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress the story; from the epilogue, the player controls Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston.[3] Outside of missions, they can freely roam the interactive world.[4] They may engage in combat with enemies using melee attacks, firearms, bow and arrow, throwables, or explosives, and can dual wield weapons.[5][6] The player can swim as Arthur but not as John.[b][7]

            After a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang are forced to leave their substantial money stash and flee Blackwater. Realizing the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws, they decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. They rob a train owned by Cornwall, who hires Pinkertons to apprehend them. The gang perform jobs to earn money, as Dutch continually promises the next heist will be their last. Following a shootout with Cornwall's men in Valentine, the gang relocate to Lemoyne, where they work simultaneously for the Grays and Braithwaites in an attempt to turn them against each other. However, the families double-cross them: the Grays kill a gang member in an ambush, while the Braithwaites kidnap and sell Jack to Bronte. The gang retaliate and destroy both families before retrieving Jack from Bronte, who offers them leads on work, but eventually double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.

        Red Dead Redemption 2 received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[59][60] The game is the highest-rated PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game on Metacritic alongside Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V,[66][67] and is the fifth-highest rated game overall, tied with several others.[68][e] Reviewers praised the story, characters, open world, graphics, music, and level of detail. Matt Bertz of Game Informer described the game as "the biggest and most cohesive adventure Rockstar Games has ever created",[4] and GamesRadar's David Meikleham felt it "represents the current pinnacle of video game design".[13] Keza MacDonald of The Guardian declared it "a landmark game" and "a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds";[69] IGN's Luke Reilly named it "one of the greatest games of the modern age".[65] Peter Suderman, writing for The New York Times, considered Red Dead Redemption 2 as an example of video games as a work of art, comparing the game's abilities to "[tell] individual stories against the backdrop of national and cultural identity, deconstructing their genres while advancing the form" to the current state of film and television with similar works like The Godfather and The Sopranos.[70]

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        EGM's Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur "far more redeeming" than John's in Red Dead Redemption, noting his sins heightened his sympathy for the character.[10] Conversely, Eurogamer's Martin Robinson considered Arthur less compelling than Marston, resulting in a confusing narrative.[74] GameSpot's Plagge felt the new characters contributed to the story's quality[63] and Mike Williams of USgamer wrote they "feel like actual people" due to their varied personalities.[25] IGN's Reilly praised the cultural variety and avoidance of caricatures,[65] and Giant Bomb's Navarro noted the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games, particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur's internal conflicts.[64] MacDonald of The Guardian found the performances led to more believable characters.[69] Polygon's Chris Plante found the political commentary shone wh

            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                Another D-pad mechanic that Red Dead Redemption 2 players might’ve missed is the ability to switch the camera viewpoint between Arthur’s shoulders. A simple tap of the left or right buttons on the controller D-pad whilst aiming which switch up the shoulder view. This technique is super useful in those close-quarter gunfights when Arthur is routinely taking cover.

                <p>
                    Normal reloading for the bolt action rifle consists of stuffing a bullet into the gun’s chambers once it’s fired. However, for the bolt action rifle there is a far speedier way to reload; hit R2 immediately after firing and Arthur will lower the gun and restuff a bullet in there in the blink of an eye. He’ll need to be aiming the rifle in order to take advantage of this fast reload mechanic. Or, you know, there is the Dead Eye exploit whereby guns can be immediately reloaded if Dead Eye is engaged as soon as the reload animation is started.
